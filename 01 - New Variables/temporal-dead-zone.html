		console.log(pizza); // if var - it will output undefined, if const or let if will throw a reference error and will break code
		const pizza = 'Deep Dish 🍕🍕🍕';

		// use const by default
		// use let if rebinding is needed
		// var should never be used in es6

		// Use var for top-level variables that are shared across many scopes
		// Use let for localized variables in smaller scopes
		// Refactor let and const only after some code has been written and you're reasonably sure that you've got a case where there shouldn't be variable reassignment
